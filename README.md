# Scribble Syntax Highlighting for Sublime Text

This adds syntax highlighting to Sublime Text for [Scribble][1], the [Racket][2] documentation language. It uses the new syntax format, `sublime-syntax`, which is only supported in Sublime Text 3 betas.

This is my first attempt at this so it is probably not complete. It seems to work pretty well in my usage, mostly due to the easy syntax of Scribble. Any improvement or suggestions are welcome.

## Usage

Put `scribble.sublime-syntax` in your Packages folder. This can be found in Sublime Text by going to Preferences > Browse Packages.... You can also put this file in a subdirectory called `Scribble`, with other Scribble related files (sublime-settings, sublime-snippet, etc.).
